== Background Info

This list was initially written by https://ficsit.app/user/6dvhEL4fWEqwcg[Deantendo]
as a SMR Guide, then later updated by https://ficsit.app/user/5gaZx7HvvPEE2[DaLumma]
and https://ficsit.app/user/CmPjgRZdvqMk96[Savage].

The SMR Guide format was difficult for the community to revise,
so it was moved here to the docs instead.
Contribution history is now tracked by the git commit history.
